# Face-recognition-attendance-system
Welcome to the Git repository for our Face Recognition Attendance System project. This repository serves as the central hub for our collaborative efforts in developing an innovative solution for automating attendance tracking using facial recognition technology.
Repository Description:

Key Features:

Face Recognition: Our project utilizes OpenCV and face_recognition libraries to detect and recognize faces in real-time captured from a webcam feed. This feature enables automated attendance marking based on recognized faces.

Attendance Tracking: With our system, users can efficiently track attendance by simply appearing in front of the camera. The system records the time of appearance along with the associated individual's name in a CSV file for easy tracking and analysis.

Integration with OpenCV: Leveraging OpenCV, we capture video from the webcam and perform real-time face detection and recognition. This integration ensures robust performance and accurate attendance tracking.

Dynamic Encoding: We dynamically encode known faces from images stored in the 'imageBasic' folder, allowing for flexibility in adding new individuals to the system without requiring manual encoding.

User-Friendly Interface: Our system provides a user-friendly interface, displaying recognized faces along with their names in real-time video feed. This interface enhances user experience and facilitates seamless interaction with the system.

Efficient Workflow: The Git repository facilitates collaborative development, enabling team members to work on different aspects of the project concurrently. We utilize branching and merging strategies to manage code changes and streamline development workflow.

Repository Structure:

Main Branch: The main branch contains stable versions of the project codebase, representing production-ready releases with tested and validated features.

Feature Branches: We create feature branches (e.g., feature/attendance-tracking) to develop new features or address specific functionalities independently. Feature branches undergo thorough testing before merging into the main branch via pull requests.

Documentation: The repository includes detailed documentation, providing instructions for project setup, usage guidelines, and contribution guidelines. Clear documentation ensures smooth onboarding for new contributors and fosters effective collaboration within the team.
